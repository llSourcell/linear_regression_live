This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 

Here are some helpful links:

#### Sum of squared distances formula (to calculate our error)

#### Partial derivative with respect to b and m (to perform gradient descent)

## Dependencies

* numpy

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

Just run ``python demo.py`` to see the results:

   ```
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
   ```
