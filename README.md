This is the code for the "[How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way](youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM)" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube.

## Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 


## Dependencies
* [numpy](pypi.org/project/numpy) - Used to manipulate numerical arrays
* [matplotlib](pypi.org/project/matplotlib) - This is used to plot charts to visualise the trend line

## Usage
Just run `python3 demo.py` from the project directory to see the results:

```
Initially..,
intercept = 0
slope = 0
error = 5565.10783449

After 1000 itterations..,
intercept = 0.000303453508353
slope = 1.48565804796
error = 112.762950378
```
