# linear_regression_live
This is the code for the "[How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way](youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM)" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube.

Siraj's Git repo here : [llSourcell/linear_regression_demo](github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_demo)


## Overview
Siraj used a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship

I've modified his code for better understanding


## Dependencies
* [numpy](pypi.org/project/numpy) - Used to manipulate numerical arrays
* [matplotlib](pypi.org/project/matplotlib) - This is used to plot charts to visualise the trend line

## Usage
Just run `demo.py` program from the project directory with any python-3 interpreter to see these results:

#### Initial values :
```
intercept = 0
slope = 0
error = 5565.10783449
```

#### Values After 1000 itterations :
```
intercept = 0.000303453508353
slope = 1.48565804796
error = 112.762950378
```
#### Graphical Visualization :
